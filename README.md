# hsleep

hsleep is a tool that will sleep for a given amount of time while
displaying a countdown.

## Usage

```bash
$ hsleep <seconds>
```

hsleep is a very simple program. It only takes a single argument which
is the number of seconds to wait for. While waiting, it will print the
number of seconds left to stderr.

So, for instance, to sleep for five seconds:

```bash
$ hsleep 5
```
